This project is for a To Do List Application using react js.

To use this app, the user types in a task and the more tasks they enter, the app
will keep track of each task that is remaining or completed. The user can edit and 
delete tasks as well. They are able to toggle between tabs that list the remaining
tasks and completed tasks. This app also features a contact form in which the user
can submit their name, email, and a message.

Technologies used:
.html, .css, .js, reactjs

Ideas for future improvement:
1. Adding a Calendar feature
2. Nav bar element that lets user view each feature one at a time.
3. Improve design interface
